## Description

The Employee Tracker is a Node.js Command-Line Interface (CLI) based application that enables Users to view and manage Employee information through a simple cursor-based Menu and manual data entry.  

The Employee Tracker programatically createds, updates, and generates views of Employee data.

The Employee Tracker ensures consistency of maintained Employee data through programmatically-standardized specifications defined by the application, and makes available the Employee data through query-generated views.

As developed, the Employee Tracker Generator is only accessible through a local instance, specific to each accessing computer.

Data generated through local instances of the README Generator will be available to all Users of the install computer, held in on-device storage and, consequently, not currently accessible through the Web unless deployed as a component of an online application or other end-point.

The Employee Tracker source code is published on GitHub, and may be cloned to individual User computers to instantiate local versions.

The app utilizes a Node.js CLI-based (Inquirer Module) Form to ingest User requirements input, and a Postgres database to store and maintain application data. 

Because the Employee Tracker output files are held in on-device storage, data and generated view will persist across User sessions on individual, hosting computers.


## Installation

The Employee Tracker source code may be downloaded from its GitHub repository, and run directly by a hosting computer.

Installation of Node.js, Inquirer module and Postgres is required for the Employee Tracker application to run locally.


## Usage

The Employee Tracker is intended for use by one or more Users to view and maintain Employee data, as defined by the application parameters, and maintain the locally-generated data which persists across multiple sessions. 

All Users of the Employee Tracker on a local computer will have full access to all generated views and data.
